# Sinusoidal Signal Interference Simulator

This project is a Python program that simulates the interference of two sinusoidal signals in both the time and distance domains. It's a great example of using Python for scientific computing and data visualization.

### Project Description

The program uses the **NumPy** library for efficient numerical calculations and **Matplotlib** to generate and display plots of the signals. The simulation is based on user-provided inputs for key signal characteristics such as amplitude, frequency, and phase shift.

Key features include:
* **User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter parameters for two individual signals.
* **Signal Simulation**: It calculates the sum of the two signals in both the time and distance domains to simulate interference.
* **Data Visualization**: It generates plots to visualize the individual signals and their resulting sum.
* **Problem-Solving**: The project team initially planned to use C++ but transitioned to Python to overcome challenges with C++ plotting library setup, demonstrating adaptability and effective problem-solving skills.

### Installation

To run this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need the required libraries, which can be installed via pip.

1.  Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.
2.  Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Usage

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
2.  Run the program from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the parameters for each signal (amplitude, frequency, phase, time, and distance).
4.  The program will generate and display a plot showing the two signals and their sum in both the time and distance domains.
